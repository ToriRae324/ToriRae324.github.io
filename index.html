        <h2>Cat people are more intelligent than dog people.</h2>
        <p>Last year, researchers from Carroll University in Wisconsin completed a study on the personality 
            differences between people who identified as "cat people" versus "dog people." One of the study's 
            most provocative findings was that cat people scored higher on intelligence than dog people.</p>

        <h2>Cats are less slobbery than dogs.</h2>
        <p>No, really — there's a scientific reason for this one. A study conducted by researchers at Princeton 
            University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that cats are much 
            more efficient than dogs when it comes to drinking water.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Cats are cheaper than dogs.</h2>
        <p>According to the ASPCA, owning a cat instead of a dog could save you a minimum of $300 to $800 a year — 
            probably more.</p>
